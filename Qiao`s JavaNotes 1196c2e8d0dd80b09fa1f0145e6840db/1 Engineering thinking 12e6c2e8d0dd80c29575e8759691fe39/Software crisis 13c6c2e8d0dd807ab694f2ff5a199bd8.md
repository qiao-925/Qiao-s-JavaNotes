# Software crisis

First software crisis：1960s to 1970s，assembly language to C lanuage to solve large-scale production problem.

Secord software crisis：1980s to 1990s，process-oritend to object-oritend to solve ever-increasing complexity of large software.

Simile：Golden Thread Clothes to T-shirt, then to suits.

Engineering thinking or software engineering is about addressing the ever-increasing demands and complexity.
