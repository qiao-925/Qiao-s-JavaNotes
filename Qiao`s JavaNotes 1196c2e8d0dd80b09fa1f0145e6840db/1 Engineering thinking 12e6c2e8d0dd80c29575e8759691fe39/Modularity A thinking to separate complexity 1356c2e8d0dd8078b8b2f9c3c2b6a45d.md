# Modularity: A thinking to separate complexity.

**Modularity is a common thinking to seperate complexity everywhere.**

For programming:  

- System level
    - Internal: to seperate large and complicated system to some sub systems.
    - External: integrate external system or support for external system.
- Package level: define package functions by single responsibility.
- Interface level: define interface functions by single responsibility.
- Function level: seperate complicated function to some sub functions by single responsibility.

In differernt level, focus on differerent abstarct degree and consider nested relationships.
