**Abstraction**: A high level perspective to focus program overall function not implemention details

**Encapsulation**: A great enginnering deigin thinking to decrease the complexity of overall system, sub system and program by focus call not details.

**Inheritance**: A language function design to enhance code reuse by sub class extend parent class fields and behavior.

**Polymorphism**: A language function design to implenment overload and override to increase the scalability and readability.
